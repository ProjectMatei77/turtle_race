Python Projects: Turtle Drawing & Turtle Race

This repository contains two Python projects that use the Turtle module. 
The first project allows you to control a turtle to draw shapes and lines, and reset the drawing with a key press. The second project is a fun turtle race simulation where you predict which turtle will win.

## Project 1: Turtle Drawing

In this project, you can move the turtle in any direction you want and create drawings using the Turtle graphics library. You can also clear the drawing and start fresh by pressing the 'C' key.

### Features:
- Move the turtle using keyboard inputs (arrow keys or custom bindings).
- Draw lines and shapes with the turtle as it moves.
- Press the 'C' key to clear the screen and reset the drawing.


Turtle Race Game

This is a Python simulation of a **Turtle Race** using the Turtle graphics library. 
In this game, you have six turtles racing on a track. Before the race starts, you can guess which turtle you think will win. After the race finishes, the program will tell you the winner and whether you guessed correctly.

## Features:

- **6 Racing Turtles**: Watch six turtles race along the track.
- **Predict the Winner**: Before the race begins, you can enter the name of the turtle you think will win.
- **Game Outcome**: After the race ends, the winner is displayed, and the program will notify you if you guessed correctly.
- **Graphical Race Track**: The turtles race on a simple graphical track displayed in a Turtle graphics window.
